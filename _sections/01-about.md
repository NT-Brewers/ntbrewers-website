Darwin and NT Homebrewers initially formed as a facebook group for the Darwin Homebrew community and has grown to host social events, an annual nationally accredited competition and smaller fun and informative events.
If you brew beer, cider or mead, no matter how long you've been brewing for or how simple/complex your process is you're welcome to join and contribute to the community.
